Choose a way to implement a knowledge-based agent that uses
inference and/or representation of concepts. 

This program is based on an example found in Chapter 6 of "Artificial Intelligence,
A Modern Approach" by Russell and Norvig. It is called the "Wumpus World Environment",
and is found on page 153 of the 1995 edition of the book.

Note: There is a bug that sometimes causes an infinite loop. I was not able to figure out how to fix it.
